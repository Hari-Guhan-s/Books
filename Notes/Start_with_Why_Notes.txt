1) This book is about a naturally occurring pattern, a way of thinking,
acting and communicating that gives some leaders the ability to
inspire those around them. Although these "natural-born leaders"
may have come into the world with a predisposition to inspire, the
ability is not reserved for them exclusively. We can all learn this
pattern. With a little discipline, any leader or organization can in-
spire others, both inside and outside their organization, to help
advance their ideas and their vision. We can all learn to lead

2)The goal of this book is not simply to try to fix the things that
aren't working. Rather, I wrote this book as a guide to focus on and
amplify the things that do work

3) Armed with every ingredient for success, Samuel Pierpont
Langley set out in the early 1900s to be the first man to pilot an
airplane. Highly regarded, he was a senior officer at the Smithso-
nian Institution, a mathematics professor who had also worked at
Harvard. His friends included some of the most powerful men in
government and business, including Andrew Carnegie and Alexan-
der Graham Bell. Langley was given a $50,000 grant from the War
Department to fund his project, a tremendous amount of money for
the time. He pulled together the best minds of the day, a veritable
dream team of talent and know-how. Langley and his team used the
finest materials, and the press followed him everywhere. People all
over the country were riveted to the story, waiting to read that he
had achieved his goal. With the team he had gathered and ample
resources, his success was guaranteed.
Or was it?

A few hundred miles away, Wilbur and Orville Wright were
working on their own flying machine. Their passion to fly was so
intense that it inspired the enthusiasm and commitment of a ded-
icated group in their hometown of Dayton, Ohio. There was no
funding for their venture. No government grants. No high-level
connections. Not a single person on the team had an advanced
degree or even a college education, not even Wilbur or Orville. But
the team banded together in a humble bicycle shop and made their
vision real. On December 17, 1903, a small group witnessed a man
take flight for the first time in history.

4) It wasn't luck. Both the Wright brothers and Langley were highly
motivated. Both had a strong work ethic. Both had keen scientific
minds. They were pursuing exactly the same goal, but only the
Wright brothers were able to inspire those around them and truly
lead their team to develop a technology that would change the
world. Only the Wright brothers started with Why

5) They aimed to make an impact, a very big impact, even chal-
lenge the way people perceived how the world worked. But these
young revolutionaries did not throw stones or take up arms against
an authoritarian regime. Instead, they decided to beat the system at
its own game. For Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the cofounders of
Apple Computer, the battlefield was business and the weapon of
choice was the personal computer.

6) In their first year in business, with only one product, Apple
made a million dollars in revenues. By year two, they did $10 mil-
lion in sales. In their fourth year they sold $100 million worth of
computers. And in just six years, Apple Computer was a billion-
dollar company with over 3,000 employees.
Jobs and Woz were not the only people taking part in the per-
sonal computer revolution. They weren't the only smart guys in the
business; in fact, they didn't know much about business at all. What
made Apple special was not their ability to build such a fast-growth
company. It wasn't their ability to think differently about personal
computers. What has made Apple special is that they've been able to
repeat the pattern over and over and over. Unlike any of their
competitors, Apple has successfully challenged conventional think-
ing within the computer industry, the small electronics industry, the
music industry, the mobile phone industry and the broader
entertainment industry. And the reason is simple. Apple inspires.
Apple starts with Why

7) Dr. King knew that if the civil rights movement was to succeed,
if there was to be a real, lasting change, it would take more than him
and his closest allies. It would take more than rousing words and
eloquent speeches. It would take people, tens of thousands of
average citizens, united by a single vision, to change the country. At
11:00 a.m. on August 28, 1963, they would send a message to Wash-
ington that it was time for America to steer a new course

8) There are leaders and there are those who lead. With only 6 percent
market share in the United States and about 3 percent worldwide,
Apple is not a leading manufacturer of home computers. Yet the
company leads the computer industry and is now a leader in other
industries as well. Martin Luther King's experiences were not
unique, yet he inspired a nation to change. The Wright brothers
were not the strongest contenders in the race to take the first
manned, powered flight, but they led us into a new era of aviation
and, in doing so, completely changed the world we live in

9) Great leaders, in contrast, are able to inspire people to act. Those
who are able to inspire give people a sense of purpose or belonging
that has little to do with any external incentive or benefit to be
gained. Those who truly lead are able to create a following of people
who act not because they were swayed, but because they were
inspired. For those who are inspired, the motivation to act is deeply
personal. They are less likely to be swayed by incentives. Those who
are inspired are willing to pay a premium or endure inconvenience,
even personal suffering. Those who are able to inspire will create a
following of people—supporters, voters, customers, workers—who
act for the good of the whole not because they have to, but because
they want to.

10) The Wright brothers, Apple and Dr. King are just three exam-
pies. Harley-Davidson, Disney and Southwest Airlines are three
more. John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were also able to inspire.
No matter from where they hail, they all have something in
common. All the inspiring leaders and companies, regardless of size
or industry, think, act and communicate exactly alike

11) people believed the world was flat. This perceived truth impacted
behavior. During this period, there was very little exploration. Peo-
ple feared that if they traveled too far they might fall off the edge of
the earth. So for the most part they stayed put. It wasn't until that
minor detail was revealed—the world is round—that behaviors
changed on a massive scale. Upon this discovery, societies began to
traverse the planet. Trade routes were established; spices were
traded. New ideas, like mathematics, were shared between societies
which unleashed all kinds of innovations and advancements. The
correction of a simple false assumption moved the human race
forward

12) There is a wonderful story of a group of American car executives
who went to Japan to see a Japanese assembly line. At the end of the
line, the doors were put on the hinges, the same as in America. But
something was missing. In the United States, a line worker would
take a rubber mallet and tap the edges of the door to ensure that it
fit perfectly. In Japan, that job didn't seem to exist. Confused, the
American auto executives asked at what point they made sure the
door fit perfectly. Their Japanese guide looked at them and smiled
sheepishly. "We make sure it fits when we design it." In the
Japanese auto plant, they didn't examine the problem and
accumulate data to figure out the best solution—they engineered
the outcome they wanted from the beginning. If they didn't achieve
their desired outcome, they understood it was because of a decision
they made at the start of the process

What the American automakers did with their rubber mallets is
a metaphor for how so many people and organizations lead. When
faced with a result that doesn't go according to plan, a series of
perfectly effective short-term tactics are used until the desired out-
come is achieved. But how structurally sound are those solutions?
So many organizations function in a world of tangible goals and the
mallets to achieve them. The ones that achieve more, the ones that
get more out of fewer people and fewer resources, the ones with an
outsized amount of influence, however, build products and com-
panies and even recruit people that all fit based on the original
intention. Even though the outcome may look the same, great lead-
ers understand the value in the things we cannot see.

(DataPatterns Does exactly what the American automakers did..!)

13) But if you ask most businesses why their customers are their
customers, most will tell you it's because of superior quality, fea-
tures, price or service. In other words, most companies have no clue
why their customers are their customers. This is a fascinating
realization. If companies don't know why their customers are their
customers, odds are good that they don't know why their employees
are their employees either

14) If most companies don't really know why their customers are
their customers or why their employees are their employees, then
how do they know how to attract more employees and encourage
loyalty among those they already have? The reality is, most busi-
nesses today are making decisions based on a set of incomplete or,
worse, completely flawed assumptions about what's driving their
business
================================================================
                        Universal Truth
================================================================
15) There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can
manipulate it or you can inspire it.
================================================================

16) And the quickest
way to do that is price again. And so the downward spiral of price
addiction sets in. In the drug world, these addicts are called junkies.
In the business world, we call them commodities. Insurance. Home
computers. Mobile phone service. Any number of packaged goods.
The list of commodities created by the price game goes on and on.
In nearly every circumstance, the companies that are forced to treat
their products as commodities brought it upon themselves. I cannot
debate that dropping the price is not a perfectly legitimate way of
driving business; the challenge is staying profitable

17) For businesses, the short-term benefits of rebates and other ma-
nipulations are clear: a rebate lures customers to pay full price for a
product that they may have considered buying only because of the
prospect of a partial refund. But nearly 40 percent of those custom-
ers never get the lower price they thought they were paying. Call it
a tax on the disorganized, but retailers rely on it.

18) "No one ever got fired for hiring IBM," goes the old adage, de-
scribing a behavior completely borne out of fear. An employee in a
procurement department, tasked with finding the best suppliers for
a company, turns down a better product at a better price simply
because it is from a smaller company or lesser-known brand. Fear,
real or perceived, that his job would be on the line if something
went wrong was enough to make him ignore the express purpose of
his job, even do something that was not in the company's best
interest.

19) Though positive in nature, aspirational messages are most ef-
fective with those who lack discipline or have a nagging fear or
insecurity that they don't have the ability to achieve their dreams on
their own (which, at various times for various reasons, is everyone)

20) Someone who lives a healthy
lifestyle and is in a habit of exercising does not respond to "six easy
steps to losing weight." It's those who don't have the lifestyle that
are most susceptible. It's not news that a lot of people try diet after
diet after diet in an attempt to get the body of their dreams. And no
matter the regime they choose, each comes with the qualification
that regular exercise and a balanced diet will help boost results. In
other words, discipline. 
(discipline in other words my father..!)
Gym memberships tend to rise about 12
percent every January, as people try to fulfill their New Year's
aspiration to live a healthier life. Yet only a fraction of those
aspiring fitness buffs are still attending the gym by the end of the
year. Aspirational messages can spur behavior, but for most, it
won't last.

21) A management consultant friend of mine
was hired by a billion-dollar company to help it fulfill its goals and
aspirations. The problem was, she explained, no matter the issue,
the company's managers were always drawn to the quicker, cheaper
option over the better long-term solution. Just like the habitual
dieter, "they never have the time or money to do it right the first
time," she said of her client, "but they always have the time and
money to do it again."

22) Impressionable youth are not the only ones subject to peer
pressure. Most of us have probably had an experience of being
pressured by a salesman. Have you ever had a sales rep try to sell
you some "office solution" by telling you that 70 percent of your
competitors are using their service, so why aren't you? But what if
70 percent of your competitors are idiots? Or what if that 70 percent
were given so much value added or offered such a low price that
they couldn't resist the opportunity? The practice is designed to do
one thing and one thing only—to pressure you to buy.

To quote my mother, "If your friends put their head in the oven,
would you do that too?" Sadly, if Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods
was paid to do just that, it might actually start a trend.

23) Real innovation changes the course of industries or even society.
The light bulb, the microwave oven, the fax machine, iTunes. These
are true innovations that changed how we conduct business, altered
how we live our lives, and, in the case of iTunes, challenged an
industry to completely reevaluate its business model. Adding a
camera to a mobile phone, for example, is not an innovation— a
great feature, for sure, but not industry-altering. With this revised
definition in mind, even Motorola's own description of its new
product becomes just a list of a few great features: a metal case,
hidden antenna, flat keypad and a thin phone. Hardly "revolution-
ary innovation." Motorola had successfully designed the latest shiny
object for people to get excited about ... at least until a new shiny
object came out. And that's the reason these features are more a
novelty than an innovation. They are added in an attempt to dif-
ferentiate, but not reinvent

24) In the 1970s, there were only two types of Colgate toothpaste.
But as competition increased, Colgate's sales started to slip. So the
company introduced a new product that included a new feature, the
addition of fluoride, perhaps. Then another. Then another. Whit-
ening. Tartar control. Sparkles. Stripes. Each innovation certainly
helped boost sales, for a while at least. And so the cycle continued.
Guess how many different types of toothpaste Colgate has for you
to choose from today? Thirty-two. Today there are thirty-two dif-
ferent types of Colgate toothpaste (excluding the four they make for
kids). And given how each company responds to the "innovations"
of the other, that means that Colgate's competitors also sell a similar
number of variants that offer about the same quality, about the same
benefits, at about the same price. There are literally dozens and
dozens of toothpastes to choose from, yet there is no data to show
that Americans are brushing their teeth more now than they were in
the 1970s. Thanks to all this "innovation," it has become almost
impossible to know which toothpaste is right for you. So much so
that even Colgate offers a link on their Web site called "Need Help
Deciding?" If Colgate needs to help us pick one of their products
because there are too many variations, how are we supposed to
decide when we go to the supermarket without their Web site to
help us?

25) Once again, this is an example of the newest set of shiny objects
designed to encourage a trial or a purchase. What companies clev-
erly disguise as "innovation" is in fact novelty. And it's not only
packaged goods that rely on novelty to lure customers; it's a com-
mon practice in other industries, too. It works, but rarely if ever
does the strategy cement any loyal relationships

26) Apple's iPhone has since replaced the Motorola RAZR as the
popular must-have new mobile phone. Removing all the buttons
and putting a touch screen is not what makes the iPhone innovative,
however. Those are brilliant new features. But others can copy those
things and it wouldn't redefine the category. There is something
else that Apple did that is vastly more significant.
Apple is not only leading how mobile phones are designed, but,
in typical Apple fashion, also how the industry functions. In the
mobile phone industry, it is the service provider, not the phone
manufacturer, that determines all the features and benefits the
phone can offer. T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, AT&T all dic-
tate to Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, LG and others what the phones
will do. Then Apple showed up. They announced that they would
tell the service provider what the phone would do, not the other
way around. AT&T was the only one that agreed, thus earning the
company the exclusive deal to offer the new technology. That's the
kind of shift that will impact the industry for many years and will
extend far beyond a few years of stock boost for the shiny new
product.
Novel, huh?

27) Leadership is the ability to
rally people not for a single event, but for years. In business,
leadership means that customers will continue to support your
company even when you slip up. If manipulation is the only strat-
egy, what happens the next time a purchase decision is required?
What happens after the election is won?

28) Manipulative techniques have become such a mainstay in
American business today that it has become virtually impossible for
some to kick the habit. Like any addiction, the drive is not to get
sober, but to find the next fix faster and more frequently. And as
good as the short-term highs may feel, they have a deleterious im-
pact on the long-term health of an organization.

29) When Douglas Feirstein and Michael Moran started the com-
pany, they wanted to be the best in the business. They wanted to
transform an industry with the reputation of a back-alley pawn
shop and give it a bit of a Tiffany's sheen. They invested money in
making the experience perfect. They worked to make the customer
service experience ideal. They were both successful entrepreneurs
and knew the value of building a brand and a strong customer
experience. They'd spent a lot of money trying to get the balance
right, and they made sure to explain their difference in direct re-
sponse advertising on various local and national cable stations.
"Better than the similar offers," they'd say. And they were right. But
the investment didn't pay off as expected.

A few months later, Feirstein and Moran made a significant dis-
covery: almost all of their customers did business with them only
once. They had a transactional business yet they were trying to
make it so much more than that. So they stopped trying to make
their service "better than similar offers," and instead settled with
good. Given that most people were not going to become repeat
customers, there weren't going to be any head-to-head comparisons
made to the other services. All they needed to do was drive a
purchase decision and offer a pleasant enough experience that
people would recommend it to a friend. Any more was unneces-
sary. Once the owners of mygoldenvelope.com realized they didn't
need to invest in the things that build loyalty if all they wanted to
do was drive transactions, their business became vastly more effi-
cient and more profitable.

30) Manipulations are a perfectly valid strategy for driving a trans-
action, or for any behavior that is only required once or on rare
occasions. The rewards the police use are designed to incentivize
witnesses to come forward to provide tips or evidence that may
lead to an arrest. And, like any promotion, the manipulation will
work if the incentive feels high enough to mitigate the risk

30) After September 11, there were customers
who sent checks to Southwest Airlines to show their support. One
note that accompanied a check for $1,000 read, "You've been so good
to me over the years, in these hard times I wanted to say thank you
by helping you out." The checks that Southwest Airlines received
were certainly not enough to make any significant impact on the
company's bottom line, but they were symbolic of the feeling
customers had for the brand. They had a sense of partnership. The
loyal behavior of those who didn't send money is almost impossible
to measure, but its impact has been invaluable over the long term,
helping Southwest to maintain its position as the most profitable
airline in history

=================================================================
31) Knowing you have a loyal customer and employee base not only
reduces costs, it provides massive peace of mind. Like loyal friends,
you know your customers and employees will be there for you
when you need them most. It is the feeling of "we're in this
together," shared between customer and company, voter and
candidate, boss and employee, that defines great leaders
=================================================================

32) It's not an accident that doing business today, and being in the
workforce today, is more stressful than it used to be. Peter Why-
brow, in his book American Mania: When More Is Not Enough, argues
that many of the ills that we suffer from today have very little to do
with the bad food we're eating or the partially hydrogenated oils in
our diet. Rather, Whybrow says, it's the way that corporate America
has developed that has increased our stress to levels so high we're
literally making ourselves sick because of it. Americans are
suffering ulcers, depression, high blood pressure, anxiety, and
cancer at record levels. According to Whybrow, all those promises
of more, more, more are actually overloading the reward circuits of
our brain. The short-term gains that drive business in America
today are actually destroying our health

33) The economic crisis that began in 2008 is just another, albeit
extreme, example of what can happen if a flawed assumption is al-
lowed to carry on for too long. The collapse of the housing market
and the subsequent collapse of the banking industry were due to
decisions made inside the banks based on a series of manipulations.
Employees were manipulated with bonuses that encouraged short-
sighted decision-making. Open shaming of anyone who spoke out
discouraged responsible dissent. A free flow of loans encouraged
aspiring homebuyers to buy more than they could afford at all price
levels. There was very little loyalty. It was all a series of
transactional decisions—effective, but at a high cost. Few were
working for the good of the whole. Why would they?—there was no
reason given to do so.

34) What I found so attractive about the golden ratio, however, was
that it had so many applications in so many fields. And even more
significantly, it offered a formula that could produce repeat- able
and predictable results in places where such results might have
been assumed to be a random occurrence or luck. Even Mother
Nature—for most people a symbol of unpredictability—exhibited
more order than we previously acknowledged. Like the golden
ratio, which offers evidence of order in the seeming disorder of
nature, The Golden Circle finds order and predictability in human
behavior. Put simply, it helps us understand why we do what we
do. The Golden Circle provides compelling evidence of how much
more we can achieve if we remind ourselves to start everything we
do by first asking why

35) The Golden Circle is an alternative perspective to existing
assumptions about why some leaders and organizations have
achieved such a disproportionate degree of influence. It offers clear
insight as to how Apple is able to innovate in so many diverse
industries and never lose its ability to do so. It explains why people
tattoo Harley-Davidson logos on their bodies. It provides a clearer
understanding not just of how Southwest Airlines created the most
profitable airline in history, but why the things it did worked. It
even gives some clarity as to why people followed Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. in a movement that changed a nation and why we took
up John F. Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the moon even after
he died. The Golden Circle shows how these leaders were able to
inspire action instead of manipulating people to act

36) When most organizations or people think, act or communicate
they do so from the outside in, from WHAT to WHY. And for good
reason—they go from clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. We say
WHAT we do, we sometimes say HOW we do it, but we rarely say
WHY we do WHAT we do.

37) Let's look at that Apple example again and rewrite the example
in the order Apple actually communicates. This time, the example
starts with WHY.
Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We
believe in thinking differently.
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products
beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly.
And we happen to make great computers.
Wanna buy one?
It's a completely different message. It actually feels different from
the first one. We're much more eager to buy a computer from Apple
after reading the second version—and all I did was reverse the
order of the information. There's no trickery, no manipulation, no
free stuff, no aspirational messages, no celebrities.
Apple doesn't simply reverse the order of information, their
message starts with WHY, a purpose, cause or belief that has noth-
ing to do with WHAT they do. WHAT they do—the products they
make, from computers to small electronics—no longer serves as the
reason to buy, they serve as the tangible proof of their cause.

38) The design and user interface of Apple products, though important, are
not enough in themselves to generate such astounding loyalty
among their customers. Those important elements help make the
cause tangible and rational. Others can hire top designers and
brilliant engineers and make beautiful, easy-to-use products and
copy the things Apple does, and they could even steal away Apple
employees to do it, but the results would not be the same. Simply
copying WHAT Apple does or HOW it does it won't work. There is
something more, something hard to describe and near impossible to
copy that gives Apple such a disproportionate level of influence in
the market. The example starts to prove that people don't buy
WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.

39) Companies try to sell us WHAT they do, but we
buy WHY they do it. This is what I mean when 1 say they com-
municate from the outside in; they lead with WHAT and HOW

40) When communicating from the inside out, however, the WHY is
offered as the reason to buy and the WHATs serve as the tangible
proof of that belief. The things we can point to rationalize or explain
the reasons we're drawn to one product, company or idea over
another

41) People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. This is
the reason Apple has earned a remarkable level of flexibility. People
are obviously comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But
people are also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from
them, or a cell phone or a DVR. Consumers and investors are
completely at ease with Apple offering so many different products
in so many different categories. It's not WHAT Apple does that
distinguishes them. It is WHY they do it. Their products give life to
their cause.

42) It is that clear correlation between WHAT they do and
WHY they do it that makes Apple stand out. This is the reason we
perceive Apple as being authentic. Everything they do works to
demonstrate their WHY, to challenge the status quo. Regardless of
the products they make or industry in which they operate, it is
always clear that Apple "thinks different."

43) Apple wanted to give an individual sitting at home the same power as any company.
Apple's WHY, to challenge the status quo and to empower the individual,
is a pattern in that it repeats in all they say and do

44) The music industry was organized to sell albums, a model that
evolved during a time when listening to music was largely an
activity we did at home. Sony changed that in 1979 with the intro-
duction of the Walkman. But even the Walkman, and later the
Discman, was limited to the number of cassette tapes or CDs you
could carry in addition to the device. The development of the mp3
music format changed all that. Digital compression allowed for a
very high quantity of songs to be stored on relatively inexpensive
and highly portable digital music devices. Our ability to walk out of
the house with only one easy-to-carry device transformed music
into something we largely listened to away from home. And the
mp3 not only changed where we listened to music, it also trans-
formed us from an album-collecting culture to a song-collecting
culture. While the music industry was still busy trying to sell us
albums, a model that no longer suited consumer behavior, Apple
introduced their iPod by offering us "1,000 songs in your pocket."
With the iPod and iTunes, Apple did a much better job of com-
municating the value of both the mp3 and the mp3 player relative to
how we lived our lives. Their advertising didn't offer exhaustive
descriptions of product details; it wasn't about them, it was about
us. And we understood WHY we wanted it

45) Apple did not invent the mp3, nor did they invent the technol-
ogy that became the iPod, yet they are credited with transforming
the music industry with it. The multigigabyte portable hard drive
music player was actually invented by Creative Technology Ltd., a
Singapore-based technology company that rose to prominence by
making the Sound Blaster audio technology that enables home PCs
to have sound. In fact, Apple didn't introduce the iPod until twenty-
two months after Creative's entry into the market. This detail alone
calls into question the assumption of a first mover's advantage.
Given their history in digital sound, Creative was more qualified
than Apple to introduce a digital music product. The problem was,
they advertised their product as a "5GB mp3 player." It is exactly the
same message as Apple's "1,000 songs in your pocket." The
difference is Creative told us WHAT their product was and Apple
told us WHY we needed it.
Only later, once we decided we had to have an iPod, did the
WHAT matter—and we chose the 5GB version, 10GB version, and
so on, the tangible details that proved we could get the 1,000 songs
in our pocket. Our decision started with WHY, and so did Apple's
offering
How many of us can say with certainty that, indeed, an iPod is
actually better than Creative's Zen? iPods, for example, are still
plagued with battery life and battery replacement issues. They tend
to just die. Maybe a Zen is better. The reality is, we don't even care if
it is. People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.
And it is Apple's clarity of WHY that gives them such a remarkable
ability to innovate, often competing against companies seemingly
more qualified than they, and succeed in industries outside their
core business
